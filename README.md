# VoC-streamlit-app
This repository is to host a streamlit app for Voice of Customer Analysis

Replace the 'final_lsa.csv' in the repository with the file to generate the dashboard. The csv file should contain the following columns = ['Sentiment', 'Time', 'Tokenized_text', 'Main Topic']. Ensure that the column names are the same, and that the file name is 'final_lsa.csv'.

Note : [Order of columns doesn't matter and presence of extra columns is also okay]
