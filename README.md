# VoC-streamlit-app
This repository is to host a streamlit app for Voice of Customer Analysis

Replace the 'final_lsa.csv' in the repository with the desired file to generate the dashboard. 

The csv file should contain the following columns = ['Sentiment', 'Time', 'Tokenized_text', 'Main Topic']. Ensure that the column names are the same, and that the file name is 'final_lsa.csv'.

Note : Order of columns doesn't matter and presence of extra columns is also okay!

Refresh ['this link'](https://share.streamlit.io/app/nivii26-voc-streamlit-app-visualize-9xla2m/) for an updated dashboard.
